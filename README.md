# Programming Exercises JavaScript

This README contains solutions to various programming exercises along with their descriptions.

## 1. Accept a char input from the user and display it on the console.
Write a program that accepts a character input from the user and displays it on the console.

## 2. Accept two inputs from the user and output their sum.
Write a program that accepts two inputs from the user, one integer and one float, and outputs their sum.

## 3. Write a program to find the simple interest.
Write a program that accepts three inputs from the user: principal amount (P), interest rate (R), and number of years (n), and calculates the simple interest using the formula: SI = (P * R * n) / 100.

## 4. Write a program to check whether a student has passed or failed in a subject.
Write a program that accepts a floating-point input from the user representing the student's mark (out of 100) and outputs "Passed" if the mark is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise outputs "Failed".

## 5. Write a program to show the grade obtained by a student.
Write a program that accepts a floating-point input from the user representing the total mark percentage and displays the corresponding grade according to the following table:
- Mark > 90: Grade A
- Mark 80-89: Grade B
- Mark 70-79: Grade C
- Mark 60-69: Grade D
- Mark 50-59: Grade E
- Mark < 50: Failed

## 6. Using the â€˜switch caseâ€™ write a program to output the day based on user input.
Write a program that accepts an input number from the user and outputs the corresponding day of the week using a `switch case` statement.

## 7. Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number.
Write a program that accepts an input from the user and displays its multiplication table up to 10.

## 8. Write a program to find the sum of all odd numbers for a given limit.
Write a program that accepts a limit from the user and calculates the sum of all odd numbers within that limit.

## 9. Write a program to print a specific pattern using nested loops.
Write a program that prints the following pattern:
```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

## 10. Write a program to interchange the values of two arrays.
Write a program that accepts two arrays from the user, swaps their values, and displays the swapped arrays.

## 11. Write a program to find the number of even numbers in an array.
Write a program that accepts an array from the user and displays the number of even numbers contained in that array.

## 12. Write a program to sort an array in descending order.
Write a program that accepts an array from the user, sorts its values in descending order, and displays the sorted array.

## 13. Write a program to identify whether a string is a palindrome or not.
Write a program that accepts a string from the user and determines whether it is a palindrome or not.

## 14. Write a program to add two 2D arrays.
Write a program that accepts two 2D arrays from the user, adds their values, and displays the resulting array.

## 15. Write a program to accept and display an array using functions.
Write a program that contains three functions: `main()`, `getArray()`, and `displayArray()`. The program should declare an array, get its values using `getArray()`, and display its values using `displayArray()`.

## 16. Write a program to check whether a given number is prime or not.
Write a program that accepts a number from the user and determines whether it is a prime number or not.

## 17. Write a menu-driven program for basic mathematical operations.
Write a program that presents a menu to the user with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding operation.

## 18. Write a program to calculate the grade of a student based on weighted averages.
Write a program that accepts scores for written tests, lab exams, and assignments from the user and calculates the overall grade using weighted averages.

## 19. Write a program to calculate income tax based on annual income.
Write a program that accepts the annual income of a person and calculates the amount of tax they have to pay based on the provided tax table.

## 20. Write a program to print a specific pattern using loops.
Write a program that prints the following pattern using loops:
```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
```

## 21. Write a program to multiply adjacent values of an array and store them in another array.
Write a program that accepts an array from the user, multiplies adjacent values, stores the result in another array, and displays the result.

## 22. Write a program to add values of two 2D arrays.
Write a program that contains three functions: `main()`, `getArray()`, and `displayArray()`. The program should declare two 2D arrays, get their values using `getArray()`, add the arrays, and display the resulting array using `displayArray()`.

## 23. Write an object-oriented program to store and display values of a 2D array.
Write a program that contains three functions: `main()`, `getArray()`, and `displayArray()`. The program should declare a 2D array, get its values using `getArray()`, and display its values using `displayArray()`.

## 24. Write a menu-driven program to calculate the area of various shapes.
Write a program that contains two classes: `MyClass` and `Area`. `MyClass` should inherit `Area` and contain functions for different shapes. `Area` should contain functions to calculate the area of each shape.

## 25. Write a JavaScript program to display the status of books.
Write a JavaScript program that displays the reading status of books from a given object library.

## 26. Reverse a string using specific method and print its type.
Write a program that reverses a given string using a specific method and prints the reversed string along with its type.
